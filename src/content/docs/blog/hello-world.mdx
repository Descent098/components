A little while ago I was looking at the pile of projects, experiments and code snippets that I had. A ton of interesting ideas, lots of useful code, techniques, and absolutely no structure. The closest thing I had to any sort of structure was my repo for [projects and experiments](https://github.com/Descent098/projects-experiments), my random [performance tests](https://github.com/Descent098/performance-tests) repo, and my [template organization](https://github.com/QU-UP). This probably sounds like a lot on the outside, but all of these together probably account for ~%10 of the actual experiments I do that are useful. Tons of them are in random folders on my Desktop, Documents, or Downloads folder. Some of them live in `git stash`es, some of them on random "rewrite" branches. Some of them live in one off repo's where I tested out ideas for a project, and need to make it more useable (like [coder](https://github.com/Descent098/Coder) and the WIP [coder++](https://github.com/Descent098/CoderPlusPlus)).

Basically, I needed something to help me capture more of the useful code I write.

## Kieran's Components

As a first peice of the puzzle I have now created [kieran's components](https://kieranwood.ca/components/), a site where I can put a bunch of my frontend experiments into re-usable components. My hope with this is to help people find either ready-to-use solutions to problems, or jumping-off points to start working with API's. Likewise this blog will be handy for short, focused posts around my frontend interests, and about this project. There's not a ton here yet, I'm still right at the beginning of the process of moving some of my existing code, but on top of what you currently see on the site there's in the future going to be:

- An editors section for doing WYSIWYG and specialized editors, both with frameworks and web-component variants to make it easy to do things like generate CSS gradients, or get information about base64 encoded images
- More focused collections, similar to the existing [observable](https://kieranwood.ca/components/stacks/astro-svelte/observable-plot/) section. Like a section for a music player and it's utilities, or various data tables etc.
- Landing pages for related projects; I'm considering doing a few different sets of web components for a common style (like [glassmorphism](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/glassmorphism/)), and I would include landing pages for those projects on here as well

As for other projects, there's still a home for my [template organization](https://github.com/QU-UP), and other various experiments, but this project will solve a lot of problems for me in a nice copy-paste way, and I hope it does for you to!
