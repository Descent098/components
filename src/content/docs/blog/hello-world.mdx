A little while ago I was looking at the pile of projects, experiments and code snippets that I had. A ton of interesting ideas, lots of useful code, techniques, and absolutely no structure. The closest thing I had to any sort of structure was my repo for [projects and experiments](https://github.com/Descent098/projects-experiments), my random [performance tests](https://github.com/Descent098/performance-tests) repo, and my [template organization](https://github.com/QU-UP). This probably sounds like a lot on the outside, but all of these together probably account for ~%10 of the actual experiments I do that are useful. Tons of them are in random folders on my Desktop, Documents, or Downloads folder. Some of them live in `git stash`es, some of them on random "rewrite" branches. Some of them live in one off repo's where I tested out ideas for a project, and need to make it more useable (like [coder](https://github.com/Descent098/Coder) and the WIP [coder++](https://github.com/Descent098/CoderPlusPlus)).

Basically, I needed something to help me capture more of the useful code I write.

## Kieran's Components

As a first peice of the puzzle I have now created [kieran's components](https://kieranwood.ca/components/), a site where I can put a bunch of my frontend experiments into re-usable components. My hope with this is to help people find either ready-to-use solutions to problems, or jumping-off points to start working with API's.

## Why

I have a history of doing these sorts of projects, and they've lead to some great things for me. Outside the "helping people out" aspect, from a technical side I think that projects like this bring a few advantages:

1. Get to test things out; Both in terms of new stacks, and dependencies. Testing both in ways that are project-independent
2. Learn what's useful; Building out library code is different than applications, for applications you can hard-code values, limit configurations etc. to just do **what you need**. Libraries require you to do more, and I like seeing what features people need for code that I didn't consider, and the challenges that go along with adapting to those needs
3. I will inherently make my code more re-usable; Where I can, I'm beginning to make my code more re-usable so that it can go on this site, instead of just cramming things together until they work. Leaving me with less bugs and maintenance burden for some of my projects

On top of the code itself this blog will be handy for short, focused posts around my frontend interests, and about this project. I've already learned a lot about [starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) in order to make this site work how I want to, and I'll probably make a post about that at some point. There's not a ton here yet, I'm still right at the beginning of the process of moving some of my existing code.

## What's Coming

On top of what you already see, in the future going to be:

- An editors section for doing WYSIWYG and specialized editors, both with frameworks and web-component variants to make it easy to do things like generate CSS gradients, or get information about base64 encoded images
- More focused collections, similar to the existing [observable](https://kieranwood.ca/components/stacks/astro-svelte/observable-plot/) section. Like a section for a music player and it's utilities, or various data tables etc.
- Landing pages for related projects; I'm considering doing a few different sets of web components for a common style (like [glassmorphism](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/glassmorphism/)), and I would include landing pages for those projects on here as well

As for other projects, there's still a home for my [template organization](https://github.com/QU-UP), and other various experiments, but this project will solve a lot of problems for me in a nice copy-paste way, and I hope it does for you to!
