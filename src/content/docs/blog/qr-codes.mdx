Today I wrote a [QR code component](/components/stacks/astro-svelte/qr-code), just a simple component that allows you to generate a QR code for a URL (an [editor](/components/stacks/astro-svelte/editors/qr-code-generator/) is also available). You actually just scrolled past it next to the title. That QR code is the link for this page, which might not seem helpful since you're already on this page, so why did I bother?

## Obfuscated Knowledge

I spend a lot of time watching conference talks, podcasts, and tutorial videos. Often when I'm watching content someone will find a helpful resource online that they don't go into, I then have 2 choices:

1. Try to google around to find it, which sometimes works, but often doesn't
2. Up the video quality and try to retrieve the URL from the video (browsers like safari don't show the whole URL btw), which often fails because OCR is not very good outside of well formatted documents

So, I now have to decide if the information is worth the time it's going to take me to find, or just move on with my life. The same thing also happens in person if someone at a conference shows me a resource (like a rep from a company), and I have to try to track it down later. 

Even worse, on many platforms having a ton of links actually hurts your discoverabiltiy, which disincentivizes best practices as a creator. Many shows I watch then have some sort of "this episode" links page that you have to go to in order to get the links, which is just annoying, and open to [namesquatting](https://www.threatngsecurity.com/glossary/namesquatting) if they screw up the link. 

Occasionally someone **does** actually include the URL, but they decide to use a link shortener. The problem with this is that I've found a ton of those link shorteners dying these days, meaning no one can access the URL. 

It's all just annoying, I just want the URL!

## Usability in all Circumstances

To try to fix this issue I added the QR codes to all pages on [Kieran's Components](https://kieranwood.ca/components/), this is an easy way to get the link when viewing from a video, or in person. If I want to show someone a component, I can just find it, hold up my phone, and let them scan the link. Easy.

If you are a developer, or really anyone who puts out information that's useful online, please consider doing the same. It works well, and solves a real issue that I've seen come up a lot.
