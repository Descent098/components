Observable is a platform for doing data processing and visualization. [Observable plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) is an open source library built on top of [d3](https://d3js.org/) for doing visualizations. If you're doing a lot of visualizations, or the main focus of your project is visualization, I would recommend checking out observable's existing tooling such as their:

- [notebooks](https://observablehq.com/platform/notebooks)
- [Framework (static site generator)](https://observablehq.com/framework/)
- [Canvases (no-code/low-code builder)](https://observablehq.com/platform/canvases)

I have also been made aware of [this project](https://svelteplot.dev/) since developing my own, and would say it's much better designed and maintained than these components.

See the [astro-svelte installation guide](./..) for how to get setup. If you're working with excel spreadsheets it's also worth checking out these [utility scripts](./../../../utilities/excel/)
