import RequiredTech from "@/components/internal/RequiredTech.astro"

This stack is designed to be a static-site powerhouse combining astro with the easy-to-use prebuilt components of daisyUI. This is my favourite stack as of writing and helps me get up and running on projects incredibly fast. **Some of these components will not need daisyUI** and just need tailwind (such as the [information card](./infocard)), these will be indicated with the required technologies section of the component page.

## Technologies

<RequiredTech technologies={["astro","daisyUI","TailwindCSS"]} noInstall={true} noTitle={true}/>

For more details on how to get started, check out the [installation](./installation) page.

## Why

This stack excels for projects looking to make heavy use of [static generation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SSG). While it can be used for more dynamic use cases, [astro](https://astro.build/) in particular excels at content-driven sites (ecommerce, blogs, documentation \[like this site, which uses astro\]). 

Combined with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) which is built on [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) you also get:

- A fully customizeable [configuration system](https://daisyui.com/docs/config/) with the ability to create your own [extended css components](https://daisyui.com/docs/customize/#:~:text=You%20can%20customize%20components%20on%20your%20CSS%20file%2C%20using%20Tailwind%27s%20%40apply%20directive%3A)
- A fantastic and easy to use [theme system](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/) with a dedicated [builder](https://daisyui.com/theme-generator/)
- Tons of [pre-built components](https://daisyui.com/components/) that have been designed well
