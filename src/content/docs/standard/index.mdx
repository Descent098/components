Welcome to the Project, thanks for checking it out!

## What

This site contains a ton of components that I have used for various projects, ready to be integrated into your own projects. 

The site is split up into two sections in the sidebar:

1. Standard; This section is for components that do not require any integrations and use just plain CSS/HTML/JS and/or [webcomponents](https://www.webcomponents.org/) with no external dependencies. Basically you don't need to install anything to use them
2. Stacks; These are tech-stack specific components that you **will** need to install certain technologies to use

## How

Go ahead and check out some of the components under the standard section in the navbar to get started! Or check out one of the specific [stacks](/stacks) if you have a framework in mind you want to use!

## Why

**I'm Lazy**, and I do a **lot** of projects/experiments. I found myself constantly searching between projects to find how I did a certain component so I could copy it. I figure why not make it easier for myself, and make it handy for other people to re-use my work. There's lots of different components in here, for various tasks I needed, and utilizing various technologies and mixes of technologies. Hope you find something useful!
